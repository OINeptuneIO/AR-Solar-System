Io (/ˈaɪ.oʊ/), or Jupiter I, is the innermost and second-smallest of the four Galilean moons of the planet Jupiter. 
Slightly larger than Earth's moon, Io is the fourth-largest moon in the Solar System,
has the highest density of any moon, the strongest surface gravity of any moon,
and the lowest amount of water by atomic ratio of any known astronomical object in the Solar System.
It was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and was named after the mythological character Io,
a priestess of Hera who became one of Zeus's lovers.

With over 400 active volcanoes, Io is the most geologically active object in the Solar System.
This extreme geologic activity is the result of tidal heating from friction generated within 
Io's interior as it is pulled between Jupiter and the other Galilean moons—Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. 
Several volcanoes produce plumes of sulfur and sulfur dioxide that climb as high as 500 km (300 mi) above the surface. 
Io's surface is also dotted with more than 100 mountains that have been uplifted by extensive compression at the base of
 Io's silicate crust. Some of these peaks are taller than Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth's surface.
 Unlike most moons in the outer Solar System, which are mostly composed of water ice, 
 Io is primarily composed of silicate rock surrounding a molten iron or iron sulfide core.
  Most of Io's surface is composed of extensive plains with a frosty coating of sulfur and sulfur dioxide.
